Vehicle Data Analysis Dashboard This project is a web-based dashboard built using Streamlit and Plotly to visualize and analyze a dataset of used vehicles in the US. The dashboard allows users to explore various trends, distributions, and relationships in the dataset, with interactive charts and filters.

Features: Data Cleaning: Cleans the dataset by handling missing values, splitting vehicle model information, and adding additional derived columns (e.g., vehicle age, annual mileage). Vehicle Distribution by Brand and Type: Visualizes the distribution of vehicle types across different brands. Condition vs Model Year Histogram: Displays the distribution of vehicle conditions across different model years. Price Distribution Comparison: Allows comparison of vehicle price distributions between different brands. Price vs Model Year and Brand: Interactive histogram showing the relationship between vehicle prices, model years, and brands. Vehicle Days Listed by Brand: Box plots showing the number of days a vehicle has been listed for sale by brand. Vehicle Age and Condition: Box plots showing the relationship between vehicle age, condition, and brand. Price vs Odometer: Scatter plot to explore the relationship between a vehicleâ€™s price and its odometer reading (mileage). Interactive Features: Brand Filters: Select specific vehicle brands to filter and analyze the data. Year Filters: Choose vehicle model years in 5-year intervals for focused analysis. Normalization: Option to normalize histograms for better comparison of data distributions.
